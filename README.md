## Usage/documentation üîß
For **documentation** and usage examples, please read the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/depthso/Roblox-ImGUI/wiki)

### Roblox Studio
If you would like to use this in Studio:
- Create a module script and paste the [library source code](/ImGui.lua)
- Download the [Prefabs UI](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/18364667141/Depso-ImGui) and paste it under the module script

```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local ImGui = require(ReplicatedStorage.ImGui)
```

### Exploits
Reference detections have been mitigated using **cloneref** which compatibility is checked, \
if support is not found, for example using this in _studio_, you are still able to use it. 

```lua
local ImGui = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://github.com/depthso/Roblox-ImGUI/raw/main/ImGui.lua'))()
```
